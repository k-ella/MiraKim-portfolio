# Amazon Sales Dashboard

##  Project Overview
This interactive Power BI dashboard was built using a public dataset from Kaggle to simulate how Amazon’s Sales Operations team might monitor sales performance and product insights.
The dataset was first cleaned and explored using Python to ensure data quality before building the dashboard.

Key KPIs—such as total products, average price, discount rate, and customer ratings—are visualized using slicers, hierarchical fields, tooltips, bookmarks, and pop-up pages to enhance usability and interactivity.
Various charts—including scatter plots and treemaps—highlight product distribution, category trends, and review patterns.

The dashboard is designed to help business users easily explore key sales metrics and extract actionable insights for strategic decision-making.
